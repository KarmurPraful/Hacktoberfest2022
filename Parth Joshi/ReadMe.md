# Creating Products Collaboratively: A Design-Thinking Case Study

![](https://github.com/parthjwmt/Hacktoberfest2022/blob/master/Parth%20Joshi/Cover.png?raw=true)

As a product solution builder, one of our goals is to empathize with our users, understand their primary goals, and what pain points and challenges they face in achieving those goals. As you learn more about your users' goals and pain points, you'll be able to build more user-centric solutions. 

This article presents case studies that show how different teams work together to achieve their goals using the design thinking model.

## Design Thinking

Design thinking is a design methodology that supports a solution-oriented approach to solving design problems. Design thinking, popularized by IDEO and the Hasso-Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford University, follows five phases in which product teams solve customer problems and collaboratively develop design solutions. The five phases are as mentioned below:

1. Understanding and empathizing with customers
2. Defining the problem
3. Ideating and collectively creating possible solutions
4. Prototyping to test the solutionsâ€™ value with customers
5. Testing with customers

### 1. Understanding and Empathizing with Customers

Understanding and Empathizing with Customers
To understand this topic better, let's take an example, one of our company's main clients, who works in the trucking parts industry, wanted to create a more modern web portal that could help their participating agents operate more efficiently. Items in the current portal are buried deep and are difficult to find due to the confusing menu structure and limited search functionality.

As a first step, to better understand the source of the problem, product managers held an internal workshop with members of the account management and customer support teams. This workshop provides basic insights such as the client's main mission, the goals they are trying to achieve, and the pain points they face when working to achieve those goals. This workshop is valuable because it allows the UX and Product Design team to familiarize themselves with the customer basics before talking to outside users. Once we've learned our client's key goals, it's time to learn from the customers directly to better understand their goals, needs, and pain points. So by asking questions to the customers one to one as a user interview, helped us aggregate the data easier.

### 2. Diverging

Using the insights we gained from the initial workshop with internal stakeholders and interviews with customers, we can able to review our findings and determine the best solution. The team decided to create a landing page that could help the client achieve their goals. We also like the idea of starting with a new landing page because it gives customers a fresh experience as soon as they log in and provides a platform from which they can access all the features after the MVP (Minimum viable product). The next step is to decide what information and features should be on the landing page to help the customer achieve those goals.

We collectively ranked the client's key tasks and goals based on how important they are to the client relative to what they want to accomplish on the portal. Lessons learned from our workshop and lessons from client interviews point to two key goals that can help us shape an MVP.

### 3. Ideating

Working with the Product Manager, the Product Designer designed the MVP solution, based on two key customer goals when using the portal. The solution is to create a home screen that shows customer information on the dashboard and allows customers to click on a widget to navigate to a screen where they can manipulate the data presented by the dashboard. We have also created a new table that displays and allows customers to search for invoices. We shared a wireframe with members of the account management and customer support team who initially attended the first workshop. They confirmed that the wireframe captured the main goals and helped the client jump straight to the part of the web portal they needed. The team consulted with the client and approved an MVP based on these two key customer goals. However, further research is needed to learn more about some of the less important goals that customers also want to achieve.

### 4. Prototyping

Product managers and UX designers created additional wireframes based on their other insights from early understanding workshops. After prototyping some solution ideas, we agreed to do A/B testing of design concepts, allowing the client to see different versions of the design targeting different needs. We have discussed the various factors that should be part of the solution. We don't want to have too many widgets on the home screen, which would cause cognitive overload, but we also want to accommodate the highest needs of our users.

### 5. Testing
The product manager and UX researcher let the A/B testing concepts with customers, who saw value in a hybrid version of the A/B concept prototypes. These tests denied a widely held theory about the customer's primary goal, saving us from having to invest in a piece of functionality that the customer would never use. We also confirmed the high value of our key features in version one. Testing shows the need for two highly rated additional features that we haven't included in the A/B concepts, which were to be part of release version two and will provide additional solutions to meet customer goals and reduce navigation performance issues.

##The Outcome

This team-oriented approach has allowed us to understand the main goals and problems faced by customers and ease their problems by providing solutions based on the goals. Every step of the design-thinking process was essential to the success of this project. By starting with our client's goals, we made sure that we buy-in from them from the beginning. Meetings with internal stakeholders allowed us to learn both about their in-depth knowledge of the system and their perception of customer opinions. Product Management and UX Design created design concepts and tested them with users, allowing us to focus on the most valuable features while avoiding creating cognitive overload for customers. Our highly collaborative approach allowed the team to create a highly user-centric version two of the dashboard.
