# Creating Products Collaboratively: A Design-Thinking Case Study

As a product solution builder, one of our goals is to empathize with our users, understand their primary goals, and what pain points and challenges they face in achieving those goals. As you learn more about your users' goals and pain points, you'll be able to build more user-centric solutions. 

This article presents case studies that show how different teams work together to achieve their goals using the design thinking model.

## Design Thinking

Design thinking is a design methodology that supports a solution-oriented approach to solving design problems. Design thinking, popularized by IDEO and the Hasso-Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford University, follows five phases in which product teams solve customer problems and collaboratively develop design solutions. The five phases are as mentioned below:

1. Understanding and empathizing with customers
2. Defining the problem
3. Ideating and collectively creating possible solutions
4. Prototyping to test the solutionsâ€™ value with customers
5. Testing with customers
