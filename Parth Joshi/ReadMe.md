# Creating Products Collaboratively: A Design-Thinking Case Study

As a product solution builder, one of our goals is to empathize with our users, understand their primary goals, and what pain points and challenges they face in achieving those goals. As you learn more about your users' goals and pain points, you'll be able to build more user-centric solutions. 

This article presents case studies that show how different teams work together to achieve their goals using the design thinking model.

## Design Thinking

Design thinking is a design methodology that supports a solution-oriented approach to solving design problems. Design thinking, popularized by IDEO and the Hasso-Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford University, follows five phases in which product teams solve customer problems and collaboratively develop design solutions. The five phases are as mentioned below:

1. Understanding and empathizing with customers
2. Defining the problem
3. Ideating and collectively creating possible solutions
4. Prototyping to test the solutionsâ€™ value with customers
5. Testing with customers

### 1. Understanding and Empathizing with Customers

Understanding and Empathizing with Customers
To understand this topic better, let's take an example, one of our company's main clients, who works in the trucking parts industry, wanted to create a more modern web portal that could help their participating agents operate more efficiently. Items in the current portal are buried deep and are difficult to find due to the confusing menu structure and limited search functionality.

As a first step, to better understand the source of the problem, product managers held an internal workshop with members of the account management and customer support teams. This workshop provides basic insights such as the client's main mission, the goals they are trying to achieve, and the pain points they face when working to achieve those goals. This workshop is valuable because it allows the UX and Product Design team to familiarize themselves with the customer basics before talking to outside users. Once we've learned our client's key goals, it's time to learn from the customers directly to better understand their goals, needs, and pain points. So by asking questions to the customers one to one as a user interview, helped us aggregate the data easier.
