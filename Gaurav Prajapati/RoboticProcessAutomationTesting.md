## Robotic Process Automation Testing 

### What is robotic process automation (RPA)?
 The “robot” in robotic process automation is software robots running on a physical or virtual machine.

If “machine learning” sounds like the beginning of a bleak dystopian future – think The Terminator mixed with The Matrix – then “robotic process automation” must be the phase when the machines rise up to rule humankind with ruthless efficiency.

First things first: There aren’t really any robots involved in robotic process automation.
Fortunately, robotic process automation (RPA) involves nothing of the sort, except perhaps for the efficiency part. There aren’t really even any robots involved in this automation software.

“Robotic process automation is not a physical [or] mechanical robot,” says Chris Huff, chief strategy officer at Kofax.

What is robotic process automation?
Rather, the “robot” in robotic process automation is software robots running on a physical or virtual machine.

“RPA is a form of business process automation that allows anyone to define a set of instructions for a robot or ‘bot’ to perform,” says Aaron Bultman, director of product at Nintex. “RPA bots are capable of mimicking most human-computer interactions to carry out a ton of error-free tasks, at high volume and speed.”

If that kind of automation technology sounds sort of, well, boring – especially compared to the Hollywood robots – that’s by design. RPA is ultimately about automating some of the most mundane and repetitive computer-based tasks and processes in the workplace. Think copy-paste tasks and moving files from one location to another, for example.

RPA automates everyday processes that once required human action – often a great deal of it performed in rote, time-consuming fashion. That’s also how RPA promises to boost efficiency for organizations.

### What can RPA do? Example use cases and business processes

Show people outside of IT how RPA could reduce drudge work in their day-to-day jobs.
Explaining and evangelizing RPA outside of IT should be a bit easier than doing so for other topics that are harder to distill down for non-technical people, such as serverless or microservices. The definitions above speak to this. It can also be easier to show people outside of IT how RPA implementations could benefit them directly by reducing drudge work in their day-to-day jobs. (The same task might be more challenging when it comes to explaining to a field service technician how, say, containerization benefits them.)


### Benefits of RPA
In addition to business process like the ones we just examined in finance, customer service, and HR, what are the other benefits of RPA? Think about what your organization could do with the reclaimed IT team time, advises Eveline Oehrlich, Chief Research Analyst at DevOps Institute.

"The productivity potential of RPA is too promising to ignore," Oerlich notes. "The technology will continue to improve, but that doesn’t necessarily mean robots are taking away jobs. Ideally, these bots will allow CIOs to free up employees for more meaningful work that will advance their organization’s digital transformation efforts. Also, remind skeptics that many vendors offer free trials so you can experience RPA in action before committing."


### How AI and RPA relate  
Even as more enterprises tap into RPA, there’s some disagreement on the basic relationship between AI and RPA. 
As our research report “Executive’s guide to real-world AI,” produced by Harvard Business Review Analytics, notes: “Some question whether RPA qualifies as AI.” 
RPA deals with structured data. AI is used to gather insights from semi-structured and unstructured data in text, scanned documents, webpages, and PDFs. AI brings value by processing and converting the data to a structured form for RPA to understand.

### The importance of an enterprise platform with both AI and RPA
As much as we love RPA, there’s a ceiling on how efficient you can be when you limit yourself to flowchart-friendly process automation.

On the flip side, if you only integrate AI, you lack the infrastructure and lifecycle support to scale and face slow integration and scaling.

That’s why choosing a vendor that offers both—like UiPath—helps you overcome gaps between departments, processes, and verticals and take advantage of the scaffolding of RPA when rolling out AI capabilities.

We make the integration of AI and RPA painless by handling integration for you and building on the RPA capabilities already native to our Platform.

While other companies work only with the underlying data layer and don’t support the full duplex of communication between front-end apps, the UiPath Platform lets you seamlessly drop in machine learning models using the underlying foundation of RPA.
